  Hi there! Here's a little about me. Please reach out if you find an overlap of interests.
</p>

1. Enjoy building + mapping deep tech solutions to complex business/technical problems. 
2. Started my career as a Research Assistant at the MILE Lab, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.
3. Co-founded and led a Deep Learning startup; [Market Learning Labs](http://marketlearning.io/) provided image recognition and language processing/understanding as a service for developers/enterprises. Result: Couldn't get enough traction & growth.
4. Subsequently, worked my way around few startups.
* Founded and organize the [IndiaAI](https://indiaai.github.io/) initiative: an open people platform that aggregates, advances and drives the adoption of Deep Learning and its derivatives. Greatly believe in the power of bring technology and people together.
* An active volunteer and member of the [SIGHT](http://www.ieee.org/special_interest_group_on_humanitarian_technology.html) Assessment Committee at [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/index.html).
* I’m an ardent classical music (the Indian flavor) listener. Maharajapuram Santhanam is my favorite vocalists amongst others.  
* I’m actively learning Yajurveda (यजुर्वेदः).
* Currently, I work as a [Deep Learning Solutions Architect at NVIDIA Corporation](http://www.nvidia.com/object/deep-learning.html).

Research interest: Deep Learning, Natural Language Understanding, and Cognitive Sciences.

Research Statement: Understand the mechanism by which the brain translates environmental signals into intelligent behavior. I’m inquisitive about the working of our brain, its cognitive architecture and would like to build applications using artificial intelligence that mimic the nous. I’m particularly interested in Machine/Deep Learning and its applications. Theoretical aspects of Statistics like probability modeling and large scale statistical estimation problems intrigue me.
